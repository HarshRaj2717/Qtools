# Qtools

## The project has been paused...

> I was more than half way through the project, but I was hosting this on a free server on render.com, which had very low RAM, and even the light tools like the video-to-audio converter were taking up all of the RAM and hence were unable to execute completely. The next tools that I had to make needed even more computing power, like the audio-to-text converter.
>
> I can't buy a server for this project currently, hence putting a pause on it. I am not closing the project completely for now, though; I will be trying to get back onto it when I can buy a better server.
